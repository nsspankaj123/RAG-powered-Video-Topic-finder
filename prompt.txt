I am teaching web development in my  web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"CSS Tutorial in Hindi [Part 51] -  CSS Validation","number":"6","start":100.0,"end":104.0,"text":" Style.css"},{"title":"CSS Tutorial in Hindi [Part 51] -  CSS Validation","number":"6","start":112.0,"end":116.0,"text":" Style.css"},{"title":"CSS Tutorial in Hindi [Part 51] -  CSS Validation","number":"6","start":108.0,"end":112.0,"text":" Style.css"},{"title":"CSS Tutorial in Hindi [Part 51] -  CSS Validation","number":"6","start":104.0,"end":108.0,"text":" Style.css"},{"title":"CSS Tutorial in Hindi [Part 42] - Print Specific Style in CSS","number":"3","start":0.0,"end":7.0,"text":" Now we will see how to print style"}]
---------------------------------
"where is styling mentioned"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
